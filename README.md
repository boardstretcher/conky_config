conky_config
============

Custom Conky Configuration

 - scripts go into .conky/
 - chmod +x the .sh files

There are some areas in the scripts that will need to be updated with your username/password/key information for them to work. also, you will have to get the correct number for your city to display weather correctly.

You will need the pizzadude font installed for the graphics to work properly, and python-feedparser for the gmail parsing.

There is a preview called PREVIEW.png if you want to see what it looks like. I took the screengrab on a debian box that does not have the pizzadude fonts, so instead of the cloud and arrows, you see a O, o and U. Get pizzadude and tweak them to whatever you like.
