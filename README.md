conky_config
============

Custom Conky Configuration

files go into .conky/

chmod +x the .sh files

there are some areas in the scripts that will need to be updated with your username/password/key information for them to work. also, you will have to get the correct number for your city to display weather correctly.

and you will need the pizzadude font installed for the graphics to work properly.

that is about it. good luck.
